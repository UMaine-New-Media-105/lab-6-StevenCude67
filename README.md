Lab 6 assignment: Create a sprite that moves across the screen and cause another srotye to dissapear. I was able to create two sprites easily, I was also able to make one of them move around (and even rotate, although it's a bit funky). I then could make the planet spawn in a random location. I had trouble making the distance function work and couldn't get the planet to change color. I nbeed a bit more time to figure it out. I ran out of class time before I could infish step 1.
